## Concepts Needed:
<b>1. Greedy Algorithms:</b>

- Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
- Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.

<b>2. Dynamic Programming:</b>

- Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
- The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.

<b>3. Algorithmic Complexity:</b>

- Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

<b>4. Problem-Solving Strategies:</b>

- Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- Iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

<b>5. Python Programming:</b>

- Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions.
- Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.

## Tasks
<b>0. Change comes from within</b>

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total`.

- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
- Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
  - If `total` is `0` or less, return `0`
  - If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`
- `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
